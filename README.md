# ARProjTHI
 
- Unity Version 2022.3.20f1
- ARFoundation 5.1.4

### Scene Structure for Build
0: StephansFolder/StartScene
1: StephansFolder/StartAR
2: StephansFolder/Introduction
3: JuliasFolder/TryImgTrackScene2
4: JuliasFolder/Game3Instructions
5: GnyandevsFolder/FoodGame

### Side Notes
The AR ImageDetection in StephansFolder/StartAR is not working in the Unity Editor, just in the Mobile Build. So for a quick runthrough in the Editor you can start from the Scene StepahsnFolder/Introduction.
